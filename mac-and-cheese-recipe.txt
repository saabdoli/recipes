8 ounces dry macaroni
1/2 sweet onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups whole or 2% milk
2 cups grated cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon dried mustard (optional)
2 cups shredded cooked chicken (See Recipe Note)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1 Cook the pasta: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente, or according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking and keep the pasta from sticking together. Set aside.

 2 Cook the onions and garlic: In a large pot over medium heat, add butter. Once the butter is melted, add chopped onions and cook for a few minutes until they turn translucent. Then add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Stir the flour into the onion and garlic mixture and cook for a minute.


 3 Stir in the milk, mustard and cheese: Slowly add the milk while stirring. The flour and onion mixture will thicken as you add the milk.

 Once all the milk is added, stir in the grated cheese and mustard. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese has melted.
